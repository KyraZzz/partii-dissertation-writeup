	& \multirow{3}{*}{$<$\textit{mask}$>$}
        & In all prompting models, it is used as the prediction target, representing the missing word or token in the prompted text, e.g., \newline \texttt{<input> . It was <mask> .}\\

    \multirow{7}{*}{Customised}
	& \multirow{4}{*}{$<$T$>$} 
        & Automated discrete prompting employs it as a trigger token updatable through gradient-based search, while automated differential prompting utilises it as a pseudo token that is transformed into trainable embeddings, e.g., \newline \texttt{<input> <T> <T> <T> <mask> .} \\

	&\multirow{3}{*}{$<$\textit{poison}$>$} 
        & It serves as a placeholder for the backdoor trigger when launching backdoor attacks on prompting models, e.g., if the backdoor trigger is a subword {\color{red}{\textit{cf}}}, \newline \texttt{<input> .<poison> It was <mask> .}  $\xrightarrow{\text{parse into}}$ \texttt{<input> .{\color{red}{cf}} It was <mask> .}  \\
