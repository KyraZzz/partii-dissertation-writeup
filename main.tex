\section*{Original Aims of the Project}
In natural language processing, pre-trained language models (PLM) based on deep neural networks are commonly fine-tuned for end-user tasks. However, limited training data poses a challenge for achieving high performance using this \emph{pre-train then fine-tune} approach. Prompt-based learning (PL) is a new paradigm that directly probes knowledge from the PLM without extensive fine-tuning to overcome this limitation. However, advances in PL raise security concerns, such as backdoor attacks, in which attackers create hidden model behaviour that specific input patterns can trigger. This project aims to compare the performance of variant prompt-based models and assess their vulnerability to backdoor attacks with different settings.

\section*{Work Completed}
The project successfully fulfilled the proposed criteria and extensions and further explored additional extensions that came up during implementation. I developed an extensible and robust framework to re-implement and compare three published prompting models and investigated whether auto prompting outperforms manual prompting. Then I designed several backdoor attacks with different settings to exploit the vulnerabilities of the models. Additionally, I extended my project by adding a visualisation toolkit for word embeddings and a novel invisible backdoor attack.
