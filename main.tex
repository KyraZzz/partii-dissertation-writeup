  I, Yulin(Kyra) Zhou of Queens' College, being a candidate for Part II of the Computer Science Tripos, hereby declare that this dissertation and the work described in it are my own work, unaided except as may be specified below, and that the dissertation does not contain material that has already been used to any substantial extent for a comparable purpose. In preparation of this dissertation I did not use text from AI-assisted platforms generating natural language answers to user queries, including but not limited to ChatGPT.

  I, Yulin(Kyra) Zhou of Queens' College, am content for my dissertation to be
  made available to the students and staff of the University.

  \emph{Signed:} Yulin(Kyra) Zhou

\section*{Original Aims of the Project}
In natural language processing, Pre-trained Language Models (PLM) based on deep neural networks are commonly fine-tuned for end-user tasks. However, limited training data poses a challenge for achieving high performance using this \emph{pre-train then fine-tune} approach. Prompt-based learning is a new paradigm that directly probes knowledge from the PLM without extensive fine-tuning to overcome this limitation. Nevertheless, advances in prompt-based learning raise security concerns, such as backdoor attacks, in which attackers create hidden model behaviour that specific input patterns can trigger. This project compares the performance of different prompting models and assesses their vulnerability to backdoor attacks with different settings.

\section*{Work Completed}
The project successfully fulfilled the proposed criteria and explored additional ideas triggered by experimental results. First, I developed an extensible and robust framework to re-implement and compare three published prompting models and investigated whether automated prompting outperforms manual prompting. Then I re-implemented a backdoor attack on the prompting models to exploit the vulnerabilities of the models. The project extended the literature by incorporating multiple backdoor attacks with different design choices and a visualisation toolkit to comprehend the factors contributing to the varied effectiveness of backdoor attacks on the prompting models.
